   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset, which includes user ratings and movie information. The primary objective is to create a recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their historical ratings of other movies. The dataset encompasses 100,836 user ratings, 9,742 movies, and 610 unique users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the project will address the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Centric Recommendations:** TO design and implement a recommendation system that tailors movie suggestions to individual users. This system will take into account the historical ratings provided by users to identify movies that align with their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering:** To utilize collaborative filtering techniques, such as user-user and item-item collaborative filtering, to enhance recommendation accuracy. By leveraging user interactions and similarities between movies, the system will generate precise and personalized movie recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Understanding:** To analyze the provided dataset, consisting of `movieId`, `title` `genres`, `userId`, `rating` and `timestamp` columns. Understand the relationships between users, movies, and their associated genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** To employ suitable evaluation metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation system. Evaluate how well the system predicts user preferences and provides relevant movie suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cold Start Problem:** To consider implementing a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering, to address the \"cold start\" problem. This ensures that the system can recommend movies even for new users or less-rated movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Interface:** To develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their movie ratings and receive personalized recommendations. Ensure seamless integration between user ratings and the recommendation engine."

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ml-latest-small** dataset is a collection of data from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org/), a movie recommendation service. It comprises user ratings and free-text tagging activities, offering insights into user preferences. This dataset contains a total of 100,836 movie ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ratings**: There are 100,836 user ratings, primarily based on a 5-star scale.\n",
    "- **Tags**: The dataset includes 3,683 instances of user-generated tags for movies.\n",
    "- **Users**: These data originate from 610 users who interacted with the MovieLens platform.\n",
    "- **Timeframe**: The data spans a period from March 29, 1996, to September 24, 2018.\n",
    "- **No Demographic Data**: Notably, this dataset does not include any demographic information about the users. Each user is identified solely by a unique numerical identifier.\n",
    "- **File Structure**: The dataset is organized into four main files: **links.csv**, **movies.csv**, **ratings.csv**, and **tags.csv**.\n",
    "- Out of the four datasets, only **movie.csv** and **ratings.csv**  will be used for the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises four files of which we will use two main files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **movies.csv**: This file contains information about movies and includes the following columns:\n",
    "   - `movieId`: A unique numerical identifier for each movie.\n",
    "   - `title`: The title of the movie.\n",
    "   - `genres`: A list of genres associated with the movie, separated by the pipe (|) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ratings.csv**: This file contains user ratings for movies and includes the following columns:\n",
    "   - `userId`: A unique numerical identifier for each user.\n",
    "   - `movieId`: The corresponding movie identifier, linking each rating to a specific movie.\n",
    "   - `rating`: The user's numerical rating for the movie.\n",
    "   - `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp indicating when the rating was provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality and Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset appears to be relatively clean, with no mention of missing values or data quality issues in the provided information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, further exploratory data analysis (EDA) may be necessary to identify any potential data anomalies or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Usage Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is intended for development purposes and may not be suitable for sharing research results or long-term studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It offers a valuable resource for creating a movie recommendation system, understanding user preferences, and enhancing user engagement on a movie platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "With a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and content, the next steps involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of the movie recommendation system. This system will leverage the rich data available to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their historical ratings."

    "- **Effectiveness in Identifying User Preferences**\n",
    "\n",

By analyzing user ratings, CF can accurately capture user preferences and provide recommendations that align with their interests. This approach is well-suited for our goal of delivering personalized movie suggestions.\n",

    "- **Scalability and Applicability**\n",
    "\n",
